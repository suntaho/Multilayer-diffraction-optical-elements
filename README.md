kinoform optics to treat optimization of wide-spectrum and high-resolution phase gratings


This work theoretically investigates wide-spectrum and high-resolution diffraction optical elements (DOE) 
that are made of stacks of low-resolution binary phase gratings. In which the two-dimensional grids 
in different grating layers are arranged with specified displacements. The common Kinoform algorithm is 
remodelled for this multi-scale architecture. Numerical computations show that, with increasing the number 
of grating layers, the resolution of diffraction fields can be improved and the stability of optical elements 
within broad spectrums is significantly enhanced. Relevant study has been submitted for journal publishing.
